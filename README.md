# ENGI301
This is a repository for my ENGI301 (Introduction to Practical Electrical Engineering) coursework

The main project is a two-player pattern guesser game made using the Pocket Beagle microprocessor.

[project_01](https://github.com/deepsn458/ENGI301/project_01) contains the python code used to run the game
[project_02](https://github.com/deepsn458/ENGI301/project_02) contains the schematics and board files for the PCB that was designed for the game
